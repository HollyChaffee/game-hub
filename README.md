### Project Introduction:
Hello! Welcome to the Game-Hub Project! This repository houses a collection of interactive games and applications built using React, Vite, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Chakra UI. 
Whether you're a gaming enthusiast or a developer looking to explore modern web technologies, you'll find something exciting here.

### Installation and Setup:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
3. Get a RAWG API key at https://rawg.io/apidocs. You'll have to create an account first.
4. Add the API key to src/services/api-client.ts
5. Run npm run dev to start the web server.

### Tutorial Source:
This project was built following a tutorial from "Code With Mosh."

[React 18 For Beginners](https://codewithmosh.com/p/ultimate-react-part1) - by Mosh Hamedani

### Learning:
This project was my first experience using React, Vite, and TypeScript. I have determined I like TypeScript, 
but I need to learn JavaScript more thoroughly before tackling TypeScript again. This was a great experience as I learned so much. 
I have more learning to do before building this kind of project independently. On goes the fun of learning!

### Current Status: 
I will be deploying this project on Vercel soon. The PlayStation platform is not rendering correctly and needs to be fixed. 
I definitely recommend taking this course as it is up-to-date, and the instructor is thorough in his explanations.
